		<h2>Some Basics</h2>

			<p>
				While Html is used for creating the structure of a webpage,
				CSS is used to control its look. The browser will go through 
				each line of text in the html file and create the objects on 
				the page one at a time in order. It looks however to the CSS 
				code to see if the web page designer chose to modify each object's
				appearance in some way. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				To give an example, html uses the p tag to create a paragraph. 
				The p tag has an openning tag and a closing tag. The designer 
				simply writes the tags and then the paragraph's text in between 
				them. The browser makes the page from top to bottom looking at 
				the html code. The starting position of the paragraph will be 
				contingent on everything that preceeded it. Tags like the p 
				tag are considered block tags meaning they normally are 
				seperated from other block tags by a line of space. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				However, we can modify where this paragraph will appear on the 
				screen as well as what color the text will be, what font it 
				will be, and its size. We do this with CSS. When the browser makes
				a paragraph from the p tag, it looks to see if there are any special
				rules for paragraphs or for that paragraph specifically that the 
				designer has set in CSS code.

				CSS creates rules for html tags in what are called selectors. If we 
				wanted to make rules for every paragraph tag that appears in the html 
				code, we make a p selector. The p selector has a p followed by an open 
				brace and then somewhere down on a lower line in the program, a closed 
				brace. Within these two braces we write rules for all the p tags that 
				appear in our html code. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Here is an example of a p selector: 
				<p>
						<tab1>p{</tab1>   <br />                 
						<tab2>text-align: center;</tab2><br /> 
						<tab2>color: blue; </tab2> <br /> 
						<tab1>}</tab1>
				</p>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Here the p selector consists of the braces and everything in them. 
				If we wanted to make a selector for another tag, for example the h1 
				tag, we would simply write h1 where p appears here. (h1 is used for writing 
				headlines in html). The two lines within the selector are declarations. 
				Declarations are rules that apply to the tag we are modifying. A 
				declaration has two parts: a property and a value. The first part is the 
				property. The two properties above are the text-align property and the 
				color property. The values are center and blue. When we give the text-align
				property the center value, the text that makes up the tag will be aligned 
				in the center of the page. And obviously using the color property changes 
				the color of the text to the specified color value, blue in this case. Each
				property ends with : and each value ;. : seperates the property from the value
				and ; ends the declaration so that the browser knows we have a complete rule.

				If we want to modify a specific paragrah, and not all paragraphs, we can use 
				an id property. When we declare a p tag in html, we specify the id for that 
				p tag to some value. We then can make a selector for this specific paragraph 
				usign this id. 
				<p>
				<tab1>p#nameOfParagraph{</tab1><br />
				<tab2>Enter Declarations here</tab2><br />
				<tab1>}</tab1>
				</p>
				
				The nameOfParagraph text above is simply a place holder for whatever we named 
				that paragraph via the id property in the html code. If there is already a 
				selector for p tags in general, this overides that selector but only for this 
				specific p tag. Notice also that we use a # mark in between the tag and the 
				id name with no spaces.

				The rules we define for a specific tag can only be applied to a single tag in the 
				html code. If we want to make a set of rules that will apply to more than one 
				instance of a particular kind of tag we make, but not necessarily all instances
				of that tag, we can use the class property. We pick a name for the class and use 
				it in the selector like in the following: 
				<p>
				<tab1>.className{</tab1><br />
				<tab2>Declarations here</tab2><br />
				<tab1>}</tab1>
				</p>
			</p>
				<p>
					"className" simply stands for whatever we want to name that class. We use the 
					same name as here in the html code for the class proprety of any tag we want to 
					assign this selector to. The class name here is preceded by a dot. This dot does
					not appear in the html tag when we assign a tag to this class just the className 
					we chose. The . must however appear here in the selector. Notice one more thing 
					about the selector. There is no mention of the p tag. We don't specify a tag type
					here like in other selectors because we are given the choice to apply this class
					to any tag no matter its type. So you could write a selector and use it for both 
					p tags and h1 tags. Class selectors, like id selectors, override any more general 
					tag selector we may have written in the CSS code.
