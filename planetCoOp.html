		<h1>Mighty Don</h1>
		<h2>A Manly Beginning</h2>
		
		<article>
			
			<p>Years ago, on the far away  planet Co-Op, lived a proud race of mighty warrior-scientist-grocery managers. 
			Amongst these galatic supermen there stood one man greater than any other, Kcodrab. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				One day Kcodrab was given a mission to eliminate a planet of evil aliens. The fiends had telepathic powers
				and were able to dicern the future, a talent they used for evil. Kcodrab made quick work of their entire 
				planet. When he thought he had destroyed them all, he was attacked from behind by the last remaining member
				of the alien race. Knowing he could do nothing against a man so mighty, but aware of the grim fate that would
				soon befall Kcodrab, the villain instead bestowed upon him the power to see the into future.

				Kcodrab's vision showed him the destruction of his mighty home planet, Co-Op. Destroyed by their galaxy's 
				Sun, Frieza, which would soon explode taking 1/4 of the galaxy with it. Thinking quickly, he acted to 
				save his people the only way he knew how, by sending his mighty son, Kakadon, to the planet Earth! 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Kcodrab thought about including others in the space pod, but decided that his son was manly enough to carry on 
				the legacy of his entire race. And so, he sent him off to earth right before Frieza destroyed the planet.

				6 months later, baby Kakadon landed on Earth. Only his ship didn't land, for Co-Opian custom dictated that the 
				ship self destruct mid-air with an awesome explosion Kakodon would not look back at making for a manly cool 
				guy entrance. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Unbeknowest to our mighty hero, the planet Earth was about to fall prey to sinister hands. For the evil neo-nazi
				organization, Jormungandr, had made a genetically enhanced super clone of Adolf Hitler, a thousand times stronger 
				and more evil than the original, but cloned for one single task, to destroy the planet!

				Fortunately for our planet, the mighty Kakadon sensed the evil doer near by, scheming in the wilderness. As he was 
				falling from the sky, he aimed himself toward the vilain, and crashed  into Super Hitler on landing, bumping 
				heads and causing Super Hitler to lose all of his evil programming. Super Hitler disappeared into the wilderness. 
				The planet was saved. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Nearby the great and powerful martial art master, Mr Miyagi, was out collecting herbs when he saw the amazing cool 
				manly explosion of the pod in the sky that baby Kakadon was totally too cool to look at. Mr Miyagi inspected the 
				refuge, and there he found baby Kakadon in a bed of mustache wax. Mr Miyagi decided to take baby Kakadon home with 
				him so that he be trained in the way of the warrior by our great Co-opian visitor.

				Months passed, and baby Kakadon grew even more powerful, but his training was too much for Mr Miyagi. Growing 
				jealous of baby Kakadon's strength, mustache, and luck with women, Mr Miyagi planned to destroy him. But he could 
				never hope to do it fairly, so he performed an evil ritual that would allow him to transform  himself into a giant
				gorilla.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Waiting for the next crescent moon arise when his gorilla power would be its most powerful, Mr Miyagi approached 
				Kakadon and told him, "You're time is up baby Kakadon! For too long have I walked in your qreat and mighty shadow! 
				I will no longer take the back burner while you get all the money, fame, and hot chicks! I see how they all look 
				at you with your big muscles! They used to look at me that way! But now they don't, but that will change now!". 
				Miyagi then transformed into a giant gorilla and attacked Kakadon. But his attack was stupid. And Kakadon knew ahead
				of time that he would try it. So he channeled his mustache energy into his mighty axe, tranforming it into a mighty 
				ever extending power axe, and chopped him to pieces.

					Afterwards he trained for years until he grew into a mighty powerful 12 year old. He then met a hot blue haired
					chick named Gisele Bundchen, whom he called Buchma for short. He helped her look for magical orbs that could
					grant her wish of having a boyfriend that would be even half so mighty as mighty Kakadon.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					On their journey they met a powerful martial arts master whom Kakadon taught his kamehamustache wave to. He also 
					met the Bullking and his princess daughter Chi-Chantal. And he defeated evil bad guys that suck.

				Then Kakadon joined the world tournament. He beat everyone pretty bad. And in the final round he fought Jackie Chan. 
				The two fought hard, but Kakadon won. But Jackie Chan showed respect because he was cool. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				But after the tournament tragedy struck as one of Kakadon's lesser friends was killed by the neo nazi organization 
				Jormungandr for no reason. So Kakdon went to defeat them for revenge.

				When he found them on his magic flying nimbus stache, they had just used the magic orbs to wish that Super Hitler have 
				his evil memories again and be a million times stronger than he was before-no a billion time stronger! So the two began
				fighting for the fate of the Earth. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Because both were so powerful they fought for days. And some smaller countries like Taiwan and Sweden perished because of 
				their mighty battle. But Kakadon won, because Super Hitler was a dick. So Super Hitler spat out a minature German Sub 
				carrying Super Hitler Junior in it and spat it far far away. Then he said, my son will avenge me. And then Super Hitler
				died.

				Chi-Chantal told Kakadon he can just go find and defeat Super Hitler Jr now before becomes evil and starts killing people 
				because of his evilness, but Kakadon said no because his whiskers were quivering from the excitement of fighting a strong 
				foe again. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Years passed and Kakadon was now a young adult. Only still a man because he was always manly. And he entered the World 
				Tournament again hoping to fight Super Hitler Jr. And he did. The two fought even harder this time. And lots of stuff 
				got destroyed because of their fight, but because of his mastery of being a super master, Kakadon made sure they only
				destroyed evil things like boring clothing stores and long lines at the super market. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In the end Kakadon won again. But he didn't kill Super Hitler Jr. Instead he said, "I will let you live because my mustache
				quivers from the excitement of fighting you again. Also I know you have good inside of you." And then he left and it was 
				over.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After the fight Kakadon and Chi-Chantal got married. And then Kakadon used the money he got from the World Tournaments to 
				start a business named after his home planet, Co-Op. It would serve to train and foster young heroes. Mighty men of valor 
				that will take up the stache should evil ever resurface. Also It would have really cheap deals and good customer service. 
				Because that's how Kakadon rolls. He then changed his name to just Don for a few years and then Don Snow because that's 
				a cool name. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The End? No. The Beginning!
