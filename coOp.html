		<h2>A Manly Beginning</h2>
		
		<article>
			
			<p>Years ago, on the far away  planet Co-Op, lived a proud race of mighty warrior-scientist-grocery managers. 
			Amongst these galatic supermen there stood one man greater than any other, Kcodrab. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				One day Kcodrab was given a mission to eliminate a planet of evil aliens. The fiends had telepathic powers
				and were able to dicern the future, a talent they used for evil. Kcodrab made quick work of their entire 
				planet. When he thought he had destroyed them all, he was attacked from behind by the last remaining member
				of the alien race. Knowing he could do nothing against a man so mighty, but aware of the grim fate that would
				soon befall Kcodrab, the villain instead bestowed upon him the power to see the into future.

				Kcodrab's vision showed him the destruction of his mighty home planet, Co-Op. Destroyed by their galaxy's 
				Sun, Frieza, which would soon explode taking 1/4 of the galaxy with it. Thinking quickly, he acted to 
				save his planet the only way he new how, by sending his mighty son, Kakadon, to the planet Earth! 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Kcodrab thought about sending others in the space pod, but decided that his son was manly enough to carry on 
				the legacy of his entire ratce. And so, he sent him off to earth right before Frieza exploded.
