		<p class ="par">An Alaskan fisherman falls into the great cold blue. 
			No one is awake to throw a rope overboard. Biting back the chill, 
			he swims to the only refuge in sight, a small chunk of ice floating out into 
			nowhere. After a short but freezing swim, he reaches his destination, but 
			the temperatures have taken their toll and the man's hands are too numb 
			to climb ashore the natural life raft. Accepting his destiny, the fisherman
			lets go of the cold ice. But just as he begins to drift downwards, he feels 
			something from below, and instead of sinking is now being propelled upwards. 
			The man climbs aboard the sheet of ice, and quickly turns to look to the 
			instrument of his rescue. He hears only a small "bah" in the distance.</p>

		<p class = "par"> Does this story sound strange to you? I can understand if it does. 
		In fact it might have sounded strange to me at one time too. But let me share with you 
		what I have found. It won't take long, and soon you too will see just how very much 
		goat is a penguin, and how much penguin is a goat.

		<p class = "par" >As the above chart demonstrates, both animals have very unique anatomotcal 
		features that other creatures do not possess. The phrase goes "If it looks like a duck, smells 
		like a duck, and tasts like a duck..." So far we have shown that goats indeed do look like 
		ducks or rather penguins. The rest of this page shall fill in what little odds and ends remain.</p>

		<p class = "par">Archaelogical Evidence<br />
		If goats and penguins are truly the same creature, would not humanity have stumbled upon this 
		revelation in the past? Humans have been around for a very long time after all. How can we 
		truly explain no one realizing the two are one and the same creature? Well, if we look 
		closer at the evidence, we shall see that this observation is not a modern one. Take for 
		instance the people groups inhabbiting the ancient mid east. Out of all the many languages
		that have come and gone in the mid east in the past few thousand years, not a single one 
		has had a word for penguin. Are we to think that people simply forgot to name penguins?
		That every other animal has a word to describe them but penguins do not? This is absurd!
		There is no word in the ancient mid east for penguin, but there is one for goat. Doesn't it 
		make more sense to say they used the same word for the one animal than there are two animals 
		and only one got a name over several milenia?
